When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case your house burns down or to have easy access to your repostiory anywhere you are, while being able to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To allow for more flexibility with your files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is applicable only to github and allows you to copy all contents of a repository into a new repository owned by you.
clones allows you to get a copy of a repository onto your local machine
branches allows you to test new feature or bugfixes without messing with the master branch
