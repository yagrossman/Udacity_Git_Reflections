When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case your house burns down or to have easy access to your repostiory anywhere you are, while being able to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To allow for more flexibility with your files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is applicable only to github and allows you to copy all contents of a repository into a new repository owned by you.
clones allows you to get a copy of a repository onto your local machine
branches allows you to test new feature or bugfixes without messing with the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so we know if that remote has been updated online and at what point it diverged from what we know locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
using either a cloud storage provider, such as, onedrive or dropbox
it would be easier for text file revisions but for complicated code it would be difficult.
